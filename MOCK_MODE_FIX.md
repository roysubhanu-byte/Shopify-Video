# Mock Mode Fix - Real Issue Found!

## Root Cause

The application was running in **MOCK MODE** (`VITE_USE_MOCK=1`), which bypassed all real API calls. This is why products weren't loading from Shopify URLs - the app was returning fake data instead of making actual API requests.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Disabled Mock Mode
**Changed in `.env`:**
```diff
- VITE_USE_MOCK=1
+ VITE_USE_MOCK=0
```

### 2. Fixed Supabase Configuration
**Updated in `.env`:**
```diff
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://wqfixzdutcfcthswmxph.supabase.co
+ VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://gwdbkxelsphjwdpqzizu.supabase.co
```

### 3. Created Production Environment
- Added `.env.production` with correct production API URL
- Added `.env.example` for reference

## Quick Test

```bash
# Start both servers
npm run dev:full

# The app should now:
# ✓ Make real API calls
# ✓ Load actual products from Shopify
# ✓ Connect to correct Supabase
```

## Production Notes

Your Render.com API is **already working**:
- `https://shopify-video.onrender.com/healthz` ✅
- `https://shopify-video.onrender.com/api/products` ✅

Just make sure your frontend deployment has `VITE_USE_MOCK=0` set!
