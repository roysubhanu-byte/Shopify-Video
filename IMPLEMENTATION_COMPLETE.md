### 4. System Architecture

#### Video Generation Flow (Designed)

**Step 1: URL Ingest**
- User pastes product URL
- Backend extracts product data
- Generates brand kit automatically
- Creates 3 concept variants (A, B, C)
- Analyzes all product images
- Returns assets with quality scores

**Step 2: Asset Selection** (To be implemented in UI)
- User sees analyzed images in grid
- Quality warnings displayed
- User selects 3-5 images
- User can reorder for beat assignment
- Frontend saves selections to `product_assets` table

**Step 3: Hook Selection** (To be implemented in UI)
- System recommends top 3 hooks per concept
- Shows filled hooks with product data
- User can select or customize
- Engagement scores displayed
- Frontend saves `selected_hook_id` to variants

**Step 4: Video Generation** (VEO3 integration)
- Create `video_jobs` record
- Generate 4 beat prompts per concept
- Call VEO3 Fast API for each beat:
  - Beat 1: Hook scene (6s, image 1)
  - Beat 2: Demo 1 (6s, image 2)
  - Beat 3: Demo 2 (6s, image 3)
  - Beat 4: CTA (6s, image 4)
- Use scene extension to chain beats
- Store results in `job_beats` table
- Update job status in real-time

**Step 5: Video Stitching** (To be implemented)
- Combine 4 beats into 24-second video
- Add voice-over audio
- Add text overlays (captions)
- Add background music
- Export as MP4 in 9:16 format

---

### 5. Cost Structure

**VEO3 Fast Pricing:**
- $0.40 per second of video
- Each concept = 4 beats × 6 seconds = 24 seconds
- Cost per concept = 24s × $0.40 = $9.60
- 3 concepts = $28.80 per product

**User Credit System:**
- Previews: Free (mock or low-res)
- Finals: 3 credits per set of 3 videos
- Credit pricing to be determined by user

---

### 6. Data Security

**Row Level Security (RLS) Enabled:**
- Users can only access their own:
  - Products and assets
  - Video jobs and beats
  - Hook performance data
  - Variant selections
- Hooks library is publicly readable
- All queries filtered by `auth.uid()`

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Why VEO3 Fast ($0.40/s)?
- Lower cost for iteration
- Fast generation times
- Good quality for social media
- Can upgrade to VEO3 Standard ($0.75/s) for finals later

### Why 6-Second Beats?
- VEO3 supports 4-8 second clips
- 6 seconds = sweet spot for storytelling
- 4 beats × 6s = 24s total (perfect for Reels/TikTok)
- Allows scene extension without quality loss

### Why 4-Beat Structure?
- **Hook** (6s): Grab attention
- **Demo 1** (6s): Show feature 1
- **Demo 2** (6s): Show feature 2 / lifestyle
- **CTA** (6s): Social proof + call-to-action
- Maps perfectly to product storytelling framework

### Why Curated Hooks (Not Scraping)?
- Proven templates = higher quality
- No API rate limits or scraping issues
- Categorized and engagement-scored
- Can manually update with new trends
- More reliable than automated scraping

### Why User Asset Selection?
- Users know their product best
- Quality control on visual content
- Avoid copyright/rights issues
- Enable brand consistency
- Simple UX = better results
