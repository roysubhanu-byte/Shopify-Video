# API Setup Complete ✅

## Summary

The local development environment has been fully configured to run both the frontend and backend API servers together.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created API Environment Configuration
- Created `api/.env` file with all required environment variables
- Configured Supabase credentials, Google AI API key, and ElevenLabs API key
- Set PORT to 8787 and NODE_ENV to development

### 2. Configured Vite Proxy
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to proxy `/api/*` requests to `http://localhost:8787`
- Enabled WebSocket support and proper CORS handling
- Frontend now seamlessly communicates with backend during development

### 3. Added Concurrent Development Script
- Installed `concurrently` package
- Created `npm run dev:full` command to run both servers simultaneously
- Added color-coded output (blue for API, magenta for frontend)
- Created `npm run build:all` to build both projects

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Updated ProductPickerModal to detect when API server is not running
- Added helpful error messages guiding developers to use `npm run dev:full`
- Checks Content-Type header to distinguish between API responses and 404 HTML pages

### 5. Added API Health Monitoring
- Created `src/lib/apiHealth.ts` utility for checking API server status
- App.tsx now displays a warning banner when API is not reachable
- Console logs show clear status of API server on startup

### 6. Created Developer Documentation
- Added `DEVELOPMENT.md` with comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guide
- Documented all available npm scripts
- Included environment variable reference

## How to Use

### Start Development (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This starts:
- Backend API on `http://localhost:8787`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build:all
```

## What You'll See

When you run `npm run dev:full`, you'll see:

```
[API] > hoba-api@1.0.0 dev
[API] > tsx watch src/index.ts
[WEB]
[WEB]   VITE v5.4.8  ready in XXX ms
[WEB]
[WEB]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
[API]
[API] Server starting on port 8787...
[API] ✓ Connected to Supabase
[API] ✓ Server listening on http://localhost:8787
```

The app will show a green checkmark in console: "✅ API server is running at http://localhost:8787"

## Testing the Fix

1. Run `npm run dev:full`
2. Open `http://localhost:5173`
3. Navigate to the Create page
4. Click "Add Product URL"
5. Enter a Shopify URL (e.g., `https://shop.example.com`)
6. Products should now load successfully from the API

## Production Alignment

Your Render.com environment variables match the local setup:
- ✅ SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- ✅ GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY (for VEO3)
- ✅ ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (for TTS)
- ✅ NODE_ENV, PORT, and APP_URL
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/healthz`

## Next Steps

The development environment is now fully functional. You can:

1. Start developing features with both servers running
2. Test product fetching from Shopify URLs
3. Use all API endpoints for video generation, brand kits, etc.
4. Deploy with confidence knowing local and production environments are aligned

## Troubleshooting

If you see "API server is not running":
- Make sure you used `npm run dev:full` (not just `npm run dev`)
- Check that port 8787 is not already in use
- Verify `api/.env` exists with correct values

See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps.
